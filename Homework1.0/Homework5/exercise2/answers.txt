1. What happens if an exception is thrown but not caught?
The program (or current thread) terminates abruptly, and Java prints a stack trace to the error output, showing the error and where it happened. For "checked exceptions," the code won't even compile if they aren't handled or declared.
2. Advantage of catching specific exceptions vs. a general Exception?
Catching specific exceptions allows for targeted error handling (different actions for different errors), makes code clearer, and prevents masking bugs by accidentally catching unexpected errors.
3. When to use try-with-resources and its advantages?
Use it for resources that need explicit closing (like files, database connections â€“ anything AutoCloseable). Its main advantages are automatic resource closing (preventing leaks), cleaner code (less boilerplate than finally blocks), and better handling of "suppressed exceptions" during closing.
