Which SOLID principles do you recognize in your solution?
S - Single Responsibility Principle:
GameLogic interface defines the responsibility of handling game progression.
TimerLogic interface defines the responsibility of managing a timer.
GameGUI is primarily responsible for the GUI presentation and basic setup.
HangmanGame orchestrates these by implementing the logic and timer, and extending the GUI. While HangmanGame does a lot, the definitions of responsibilities are separated by interfaces.
O - Open/Closed Principle:
The system is open for extension (e.g., you could create a different type of GameLogic or TimerLogic implementation) but closed for modification (the interfaces themselves, once defined and used, shouldn't need to change to add new types of games/timers).
L - Liskov Substitution Principle:
Anywhere you expect a GameLogic, you should be able to substitute a HangmanGame instance. The same applies to TimerLogic. Code written against the interfaces will work with any valid implementation.
I - Interface Segregation Principle:
We've created two distinct, client-specific interfaces (GameLogic, TimerLogic) rather than one large, general-purpose "Game" interface. Clients (like a part of the system only interested in timing) don't need to depend on methods they don't use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle:
High-level modules (e.g., a game orchestrator if we had one) could depend on abstractions (the interfaces GameLogic, TimerLogic) rather than concrete low-level implementations (HangmanGame). HangmanGame itself depends on the GameGUI abstraction for its UI.


How does using interfaces improve the flexibility of your design?
Pluggability: You can easily swap out implementations. For example, you could create a HangmanGameAdvancedLogic that implements GameLogic with different rules, or a NoTimerLogic that implements TimerLogic with an empty startTimer() method, without changing the code that uses these interfaces (if it's programmed to the interface).
Decoupling: Components become less dependent on each other's concrete classes. HangmanGame implements GameLogic, but other parts of a larger system wouldn't need to know it's specifically HangmanGame if they only need the GameLogic contract.
Testability: It's easier to create mock objects or test doubles that implement these interfaces for unit testing, isolating components.


What benefits does this modular design using interfaces offer in larger, more complex projects?
Improved Maintainability: Changes to one implementation (e.g., how the timer works) are less likely to break other parts of the system, as long as the interface contract is maintained.
Enhanced Reusability: Well-defined interfaces and their implementing components can potentially be reused in other projects or different parts of the same project.
Parallel Development: Different teams can work on different implementations of interfaces simultaneously, as long as the interface contract is agreed upon.
Clearer Architecture: Interfaces help define clear boundaries and contracts between different modules or layers of an application, making the overall system easier to understand and reason about.
Scalability: As the project grows, it's easier to add new features or modify existing ones by introducing new interface implementations or extending existing ones without massive rewrites.
